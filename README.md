Didn't pay enough attention, accidentally pushed as Unknown lmao.

Anyways this is a survival horror game made with Unity, the stages are randomly generated with ML model.

Essentially you just have to find the 3 items to win, the compas will show 4 objectives, one of them is a decoy (a feature, not a bug).
You'll find the ML model in this repository.
